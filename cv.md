## About me ##

I have about 1 year of commercial experience working in the frontend in a small web studio, my team was - 4 frontend dev, 2 backend dev and UI UX designer.

During my work I worked with such technologies as HTML, CSS (SCSS), JS (JQuery) using BEM methodology.I was creating simple landing pages and help developers create online stores (using WooCommerce) as well as huge project for rent accommodation for European customer. 

To create web pages I use a flex model without using any CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Materialize but I am ready to study in the shortest possible time the technologies and frameworks that are needed according with the requirements of the project or company standards. 

To build the project I’m using Gulp and I have general knowledge with Webpack too.
I’m working with  IDE such PHPStorm/WEBStorm and Visual Studio Code. I know how to work with GIT and Github

In addition, I have about 1 year of digital marketing experience in an American company.There were 2 developers in my team, a UI UX designer and a 3D designer, thanks to this work I gained skills to work in a team, create a work plan, set priorities and be responsible for the result, in addition I could improve my English by communicating often with colleagues from the USA (currently my level is approximately  B1+ - B2).

I have a good level with graphic editors such as Figma, Avocode, Adobe XD and Filmora video editor. I have experience in running advertising campaigns with Facebook AD, SMM and understand the importance of writing semantically correct code for SEO. I also have a basic knowledge of mySQl, AJAX and understand how HTTP queries work.
